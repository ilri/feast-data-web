                    The <b>Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST)</b> consists of a simple and brief, quantitative questionnaire and software application to aid in the assessment of local feed resource availability and use. This website provides a central repository of FEAST project data, where facilitators may upload their data then download aggregated data sets from around the world for further analysis.  The data is intended to provide insights into feed availability, quality and seasonality to help inform intervention strategies.
